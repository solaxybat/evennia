  "body": "Startide IV is a text-based RPG based upon the world and setting developed by Corvidae and Drakkon from the original Startide Game. Featuring a colony ship sent from an Earth whose natural resources were running out soon after the end of World War II, the story of the colonists aboard the Startide III ship came to an abrupt halt when the server could no longer be sustained.\r\n\r\nNow with a rewritten backstory, and several years of story development and more then a few MU* servers of coding attempts, the story of the Startide IV is being brought to the Evennia platform in the hope that it will finally find the time to be completed.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the Startide IV experience has been the use of HSpace by Revian, and part of this forked project is to bring the HSpace experience into the Evennia/ Python environment.\r\n\r\nAbout Evennia:\r\n\r\nEvennia MUD/MU\\* Creation System\r\n================================\r\n\r\n*Evennia* is an open-source Python-based MUD/MU\\* server/codebase using modern technologies.
